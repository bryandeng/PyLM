Structure of prob_dict (probability dictionary):


A Python dictionary with the following key:value pairs:

{string: (log10_prob, log10_backoff (if there is))}

"string" is a Python str like "PyLM is good".
Note that lists can't be used as keys for a Python dict, so convert a word
list to str using "tokens2str()" function in misc submodule before querying.


This format is consistent throughout the whole PyLM module.
